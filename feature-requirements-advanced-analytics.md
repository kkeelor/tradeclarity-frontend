# Trading Analytics App - Feature Requirements
## Advanced Insights & Performance Analytics

---

## Feature 1: Realized vs Unrealized P&L Dashboard

### Objective
Provide clear separation between locked-in profits/losses (realized) and potential gains/losses from open positions (unrealized), giving traders instant clarity on their actual vs paper profits.

### Requirements

**Display Components:**
1. **Primary Metrics Card**
   - Total Realized P&L (closed positions only)
   - Total Unrealized P&L (open positions only)
   - Combined Total P&L
   - Visual breakdown showing % of each

2. **Timeline View**
   - Graph showing realized P&L accumulation over time (step function)
   - Floating line showing unrealized P&L fluctuating in real-time
   - Ability to see historical unrealized P&L at any point in time

3. **Position-Level Breakdown**
   - Table of all open positions showing unrealized P&L for each
   - Mark-to-market values with current prices
   - Breakeven prices clearly indicated
   - % gain/loss from entry for each position

**Calculations:**
- Realized P&L = Sum of all closed position profits/losses (from income records for futures, calculated from trades for spot)
- Unrealized P&L = Sum of (currentPrice - entryPrice) × positionSize for all open positions
- Account for commissions and funding fees in both

**User Value:**
"See exactly how much money you've actually made (withdrawn-able) vs how much is still at risk in the market"

---

## Feature 2: XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return)

### Objective
Calculate time-weighted returns that account for deposits, withdrawals, and the timing of cash flows, providing the most accurate measure of trading performance regardless of when capital was added or removed.

### Requirements

**Core Calculation:**
- Implement XIRR algorithm (similar to Excel's XIRR function)
- Track all cash flows with timestamps:
  - Initial deposits
  - Additional deposits
  - Withdrawals
  - Current portfolio value (final cash flow)
  
**Display Components:**
1. **XIRR Percentage**
   - Annualized return rate
   - Comparison to simple ROI
   - Explanation: "Your money grew at X% per year after accounting for all deposits and withdrawals"

2. **Cash Flow Timeline**
   - Visual graph showing when money entered/exited
   - Color-coded: Green (deposits), Red (withdrawals), Blue (current value)
   - Tooltips showing exact amounts and dates

3. **Comparative Context**
   - Show XIRR vs Simple ROI
   - Explain difference in plain language
   - Example: "XIRR is 45% but ROI is 30% because you added more capital during a winning streak"

**Data Requirements:**
- Detect deposits (balance increases without corresponding trades)
- Detect withdrawals (balance decreases without corresponding trades)
- Handle transfers between spot and futures wallets
- Store timestamp for each cash flow event

**User Value:**
"Know your TRUE annualized return, not just 'total profit divided by total invested' which ignores WHEN you invested"

---

## Feature 3: Performance vs Bitcoin/Market Indexes

### Objective
Benchmark trading performance against "buy and hold" strategies to show if active trading is actually outperforming passive investment.

### Requirements

**Benchmark Options:**
1. **Bitcoin (BTC)**
   - If you had just bought and held BTC with the same capital
   
2. **Ethereum (ETH)**
   - Alternative crypto benchmark

3. **Crypto Index**
   - Weighted basket (e.g., 60% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% others)

4. **Traditional Markets** (Optional)
   - S&P 500 index
   - Nifty 50 (for Indian users)

**Display Components:**
1. **Comparison Chart**
   - Line graph showing your portfolio value vs benchmark(s) over time
   - Same starting capital for fair comparison
   - Clearly show divergence points (where you beat or fell behind)

2. **Performance Metrics Table**
   ```
   | Metric          | Your Trading | BTC Buy & Hold | Difference |
   |-----------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
   | Total Return    | +85%         | +60%           | +25% ✅    |
   | Max Drawdown    | -35%         | -45%           | +10% ✅    |
   | Sharpe Ratio    | 1.8          | 1.2            | +0.6 ✅    |
   | Time to Recover | 14 days      | 28 days        | 2x faster  |
   ```

3. **Insight Callouts**
   - "You outperformed Bitcoin by 25% - your active trading added value!"
   - "You had 10% less drawdown than BTC - better risk management!"
   - OR "You underperformed Bitcoin by 15% - consider a buy & hold strategy"

**Calculation Logic:**
- Use same time period as user's trading history
- Apply same capital injection timing (if user added $1000 on Jan 15, add $1000 to benchmark on Jan 15)
- Account for fees (assume minimal exchange fees for benchmark)

**User Value:**
"Prove whether your trading skills actually beat just holding Bitcoin - the ultimate reality check"
